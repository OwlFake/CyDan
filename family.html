                <h1>Family</h1>
                
                <p>Congrats on successfully navigating my love. I just wanna say thank you for everything you've been doing for us lately. Introducing me to your parents is a big step and I want you to know na I really appreciate you doing that. I'm sorry I wasn't really that great back then pero there are always room for improvement. I'm sorry for being so shy, pero they are great people and I enjoyed their company even with your other relatives.</p>

                <p>I just wanna say love na I'm sorry for being an emotional mess lately. I'll be better for the both of us, I swear. I love you so much love love ko. Also, if they asked me why I fall in love with you. I would've answered them the following:</p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <p>"It's kind of a long story po tito and tita, you might think na I love her just for the connections whatsoever, which truthfully I really don't care about at all. It's just, way before I even knew her job, she already made me feel very special. She appreciates someone like me who was a mess at the time and it's something I really didn't expect at the time. Then I started getting to know her, the hardships she endured, the weakness she conquered and all of her stories really made me admire her even more than ever before. If she was a princess, I'd immediately work as a knight to your kingdom po tito and tita. She showed me kindness, compassion, affection and love that I would love nothing more than to give it back to her 10 folds. Because I know she deserves it."</p>
                </div>

                <p class="last-paragraph">Someday I'll have the opportunity to prove to them that I'm worthy to be your partner in life, and I'll make the most out of it. I don't want you to be choosing between me and your family so I'll do everything para matanggap nila ako. I love you so much love love ko. Muwah Muwah Muwah!!!</p>
